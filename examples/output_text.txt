1. Whitespace steganography - using spaces and tabs at the end of lines 
2. Zero-width character steganography - using invisible Unicode characters	
 
Both methods allow hiding binary data without visibly altering the appearance 
of the text file to human readers.	
 
This is an example text file that will be used for steganography testing. 
It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate how data can be hidden

Both methods allow hiding binary data without visibly altering the appearance 
of the text file to human readers.	
	
This is an example text file that will be used for steganography testing. 
It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate how data can be hidden 
in text files using different steganography techniques. 
 
The steganography module supports two main methods for text files: 
1. Whitespace steganography - using spaces and tabs at the end of lines	
2. Zero-width character steganography - using invisible Unicode characters
